The purpose of this git repository is to show the work I have done in my Web Development class.

My favorite assignment was the Marauder's Map as it was the first time I used an API in my program and I now feel as though I can add API's easily to enhance my appllications. 

I feel as though I have grow a lot since the beginning of this course as I now have the skills to make most web applications and explore new frameworks.

The most important thing I learned in this class was how to run a server and connect my web application as in Assignment 3 and my Final Project.

Now that I have finished the course I would like to delve deeper into front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Django. I have started using Bootstrap for the Final Project but think it is a great tool to know and makes creating web applications a lot easier.
